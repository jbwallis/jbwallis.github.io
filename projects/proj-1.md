title: 'B20 Cooling System'
---

For this project, I was responsible for designing the cooling system for the Berkeley Formula Racing 2020 car (B20). 
This entailed selecting an appropriate radiator, designing the mounting system and fan ducting, and laying out plumbing.

One of the main challenges for tis project was accommodating a new, larger engine package.
